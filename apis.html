    <p> Professor DiOrio had stated Zippopotam.us as one of the examples in the slideshow when we learned AJAX, but she did not dwell on it much in class, so I decided to explore it myself. 
      It is cited <a href="https://api.zippopotam.us/">here.</a>
    <br><br>
     I used an API option that uses the zip code, made an AJAX request, picking the keys representing the city and state abbreviation. 
    <br><br>
     This already seems like a very useful API based only on its utility with zip code information to reveal city and state information. 
     I believe this API could be utilized effectively on UberEats, where entering your zip code reveals which city you are in and allows 
     the service to locate the restaurants that deliver in your area. Another useful application of this API would be on Amazon, to reveal whether
     the zip code you are requesting a delivery to falls within the radius of Amazon's capabilities. A third application, which I thought of 
     with reference to my midterm project, is that for SteerMyEvent, entering your zip code could match you to the venues that are present 
     in your area for reservation, and show you information only about them instead of exposing you to unnecessary data about tens of other 
     venues. </p>
